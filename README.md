# 90 days of Devops with Roxs

## What DevOps is?

DevOps is a collaborative engineering culture that integrates development and operations teams to enhance the efficiency of the software delivery lifecycle. By promoting shared responsibility, automation, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) practices, DevOps minimizes environment discrepancies and resolves issues like the common "it works on my machine but not in production" scenario.
